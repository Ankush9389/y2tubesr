Build a fully working YouTube video and Shorts downloader website with the following requirements:

1. Features:
- Allow users to input any YouTube video or Shorts URL.
- Provide download options for video+audio in 360p and 720p quality.
- Use the latest version of yt-dlp for fast, reliable fetching and downloading.
- Download should happen quickly in one go, no segmented downloading.
- No history or user data is saved on the server or client.
- Solve all download-related problems directly, ensuring smooth user experience.

2. Design:
- Follow a clean, elegant, light-themed UI inspired by high-end developer component library homepages.
- Use a white #ffffff background with generous whitespace.
- Bold and large headline typography (48px+, weight 600-800).
- Body text in neutral gray #6b7280 with comfortable reading size.
- UI elements like cards and sections should have subtle rounded corners (~0.75rem) and soft shadows.
- Layout should be full-width but content centered with max width ~1200px, using flexible grid or columns.
- Navigation: a sticky minimal top bar with a simple logo on left and minimal navigation on right.
- Include a prominent CTA button in the hero section.
- Interactive elements should have smooth hover and active states with gentle transitions.
- Use semantic HTML5, accessibility best practices, minimal and clean JavaScript.
- Style with utility-first CSS framework (e.g. Tailwind CSS) or equivalent for responsiveness and modern UI.

3. Technical:
- Frontend and backend can be combined into a single app where yt-dlp core logic is invoked securely.
